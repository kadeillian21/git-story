This is a story about a man with a green shoe.  I know what you are thinking: "A green shoe?  Who only has a green shoe?!  Shouldn't you at least..." I am going to stop you right there.  You are wasting our precious lines with your ceaseless babbling.  Instead, sit back, and relax, and let me tell you a storu about the man with the green shoe.
In a land far far away, there lived a man in a tin can that wore green shoes.  In this tin can, where there lived a man, there also lived a woman.  This woman wore the finest furs that money could buy.  One day, the woman said to the man, "John, why must you wear those green shoes?"
